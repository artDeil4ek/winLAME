# winLAME

winLAME is an easy to use encoder for many audio formats, including MP3, Opus,
Ogg Vorbis and more. winLAME uses the LAME mp3 encoder.

winLAME lets you read in audio tracks from CDs or encode audio files from your
hard drive. The intuitive wizard-style user interface makes it easy to set up
encoding settings. Multicore CPUs are used to parallelize encoding tasks.

The official winLAME home page is located at: https://winlame.sourceforge.io/
