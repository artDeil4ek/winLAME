Compiling tips for winlame
--------------------------

getting source
--------------

compiling winlame should be fairly easy. Just download the latest source
package from the developer page at sourceforge, located at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/winlame/

or, if you want the latest source code, download the daily CVS tarball:

  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/winlame-cvsroot.tar.gz

but note, that compiling this may not work, as the CVS tree is always under
development.

to successfully run winlame you need some DLL's, which are located in the latest
binary release. just copy all DLL's in the output/debug or output/release folder.


extracting
----------

just extract the winlame source code zip file to any directory you please.


compiling
---------

start the visual studio and load the workspace file. choose the winlame
project as the current project, choose a build target, either "Win32 Debug"
or "Win32 Release" and press F7, select "Build -> Rebuild All" or any other
method to compile the current project.

compiling the HTML help file is done via a separate batch file located in the
sources/htmlhelp folder, called buildhelp.bat.
note that compiling the HTML help file requires the full HTML help workshop
installed, which should be available at

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/htmlhelp.exe

misc.
-----

all output (object files, intermediate files and so on) will be put into sub
folders of the output folder.
