Compiling tips for winlame
--------------------------

Getting source
--------------

Compiling winlame should be fairly easy. Just download the latest source
package from the developer page at sourceforge, located at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/winlame/

or, if you want the latest source code, clone the Git repository:

  git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/winlame/code winlame-code


Compiling
---------

Start Visual Studio and load the solution (.sln) file. Choose the winLAME
project as the start up project, choose a build target, either "Debug"
or "Release" and press F7, select "Build -> Rebuild All" or any other
method to compile the current project.

Note that compiling the HTML help file requires the full HTML help workshop
installed, which should be available at

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/htmlhelp.exe

All output (object files, intermediate files and so on) will be put into sub
folders of the main folder.
