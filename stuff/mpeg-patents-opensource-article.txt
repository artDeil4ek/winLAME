MPEG, Patents, and Open Source 
by Eric D. Scheirer 

Two  of  the  hottest  topics  in  computing today  are  MP3  and  the
open-source movement. There have been many calls on Slashdot and other
Linux forums  to develop "open-source open standards"  to compete with
audio standards containing intellectual property that is encumbered by
patents.

Here  I'll try  to  identify and  explain  some of  the patent  issues
relevant  to MPEG  audio  standards, and  discuss  the possibility  of
developing an open-source format. I am  not a lawyer, so nothing I say
should be  regarded as legal advice.  Most of what I  say is organized
specifically  around MP3  technology, but  most of  the  general ideas
apply to other MPEG audio standards as well.

MPEG and patent rights

"Why  does  MPEG  allow   patented  technology  into  supposedly  open
standards?"

When I speak  with Internet developers, I am  asked this question more
than any other. Most of the  technologies we have come to depend on as
part of the infrastructure of the Internet, such as Sendmail and HTTP,
are not patented.  It seems surprising that a  technology beginning to
hold similar importance -- MP3 for the distribution of music -- is not
equally free and clear.

To understand  the situation,  we have  to go back  many years  to the
beginning of  MPEG development. In 1988,  when MPEG began  work on the
MP3  standard,  the  Internet  was  not  a  serious  concern  for  any
multimedia  developer.  The view  at  the  time  was that  "multimedia
convergence" was beginning and would lead to a large reorganization of
the consumer  electronics industry. Few people  foresaw the importance
of the Internet.

The companies interested in multimedia technology when MPEG was formed
were  large media  and consumer  electronics companies.  The corporate
culture   of  the   Internet-nimble,  smart,   fast-moving,  high-tech
companies-had not  yet developed.  The old-model companies  working in
MPEG are the ones most comfortable with buying and selling licenses to
patents.

As  part  of  its  first  activities, MPEG  developed  its  policy  on
intellectual  property.  This policy  has  words  to  the effect  that
patented technology  is permitted in MPEG standards,  but that patents
must be  licensed on a fair  and equitable basis to  all comers.  This
prevents patent-holders  from wielding their  portfolios as a  tool to
keep  their  competitors from  building  decoders.  This model  seemed
perfectly  fair to  the developers  of the  standard --  none  of them
resented having to pay for  other companies' technology, and they were
all working together on the standards anyway.

The MPEG-1 audio standard, which provided the base technology for MP3,
was completed  in 1992. At  this time, the  World Wide Web  was barely
under development and digital music commerce was nonexistent.

MP3 was used  only for niche applications, such  as CD-ROM videogames,
until late 1997.

By  this time,  the Internet  revolution was  in full  swing,  and the
beginnings of an underground movement in the exchange of digital music
were beginning.  New software  such as Winamp  emerged to  target this
movement,  and  the  software-tools  market  and  the  music  movement
fostered each other's growth.

A problem arose. The sorts of  organizations that wanted to use MP3 --
whether as part of a business model  or just for fun -- were no longer
the sorts of organizations that had developed the standard and set the
licensing  terms. The Internet  music company,  the hobbyist,  and the
open-source developer have had no  voice in determining what "fair and
equitable"  means,  and  had  no  patents  of  their  own  to  use  as
leverage. So they are left out in the cold in setting licensing terms.

In some sense, the MP3 community should have known what it was getting
into  when  the  MP3  technology  was selected  for  the  exchange  of
music. MP3 was a standard made by big companies for big companies. But
of course, this is a strange way to put it, since these "decisions" in
the MP3 community were made as  a consequence of evolution, not by any
sort of formal group.

MP3  has never  been promoted  as a  "free" format  by the  people who
developed it  -- it was  early adopters on  the Internet who  chose to
disregard  or not  learn  about the  patent-encumbered  status of  the
technology.

The current world of MP3 patents

It  is important  to  understand the  difference  between patents  and
copyrights as they  apply to technology like audio  coding. Both kinds
of limitations apply to MP3 technology.

On the one  hand, there is the copyright  that a particular programmer
holds  on  a  particular  piece  of source  code  that  implements  an
algorithm.  For example,  Fraunhofer (among  others)  developed source
code that decodes  an MP3 file. They own the  copyright on this source
code, and  can use  it as they  wish, selling  it, giving it  away, or
keeping it all to themselves.

If  you build  a  new  decoder without  looking  at Fraunhofer's  code
(called a "clean-room" implementation),  you own the copyright on that
code,  and Fraunhofer  has  no claim  to  it. So  you  can get  around
Fraunhofer's  licensing  costs  on  the  copyright to  their  code  by
building a new player yourself.

On the other hand, some companies hold patent rights in the underlying
technology.   These  patents   apply  not   only  to   one  particular
implementation of  the idea,  but also to  any implementation  of that
idea. In order to have technology in MPEG standards, companies have to
agree to give  up certain rights on their patents.  A company owning a
patent on an MPEG technology cannot keep it all to themselves, nor can
they charge "unfair" licensing fees.

But even if you build a clean-room implementation of the code, you are
still governed by  the patent claims of the  patent holders. You can't
get   around  the   patent-licensing  costs   by  building   your  own
implementation  -- you  owe the  license fees  whether you  created it
yourself or bought it from the rights holder.

The patents for  MP3 are "pooled." This means that  one may approach a
single organization, called the  licensing authority, to get a license
that covers all of the patents  on the standard. This is a good thing,
because otherwise you'd  have to go to all  the different companies to
negotiate licenses separately, quite an ordeal.

The licensing  authority asserts that  different terms of  payment are
required for  different applications (there's a whole  chart here. You
need one sort  of license to sell decoders,  another to sell encoders,
and another to sell music encoded in MP3 format.

I  use   the  word   "assert"  here  deliberately;   it  is   not  the
patent-holder,  but  the  courts,  that ultimately  decide  whether  a
particular use of a technology violates  a patent. It is not up to the
patent  holders to decide  whether MP3  patents prohibit  another from
using the codec a certain way.  Rather, they would sue if they thought
one was in violation, and a court would rule.

As far as  I know, terms asserted as "required"  by the MPEG licensing
authority have never actually been tested in patent litigation.

On developing open-source audio coders

Even if MPEG had foreseen use  of its audio coding technology for such
a wide range of Internet-related  purposes, there is another reason to
allow the  use of  patented technology in  standards: all of  the best
technology is held under patent.

If MPEG had not allowed standards to contain patented technology (this
is  the  approach taken  by,  for example,  the  W3C),  then the  open
standard would simply not be  as good as the proprietary standards. In
the long  run it was viewed  that this would fracture  the market, and
would  inspire development  of multiple  independent  and incompatible
solutions.

Developing new audio coding technology is hard.

Unlike many other sorts of applications, creating a totally new format
for sound  compression requires years of research  by very experienced
people.  Following  such research,  it's  a  fairly  simple matter  to
actually build the player.  Development of the MPEG-AAC codec involved
perhaps 100  person-years of collaborative  development by all  of the
top researchers in the field.

No other  Internet technology requires such intense  focus by experts.
For example,  if it  were necessary, there  are thousands  of computer
experts  with  the  skill  necessary  to build  a  new  Sendmail  from
scratch.  Even operating systems,  very complex  in operation,  can be
built successfully  by a large  team of above-average  programmers not
individually working at the state-of-the-art in the field.

But development  of new coding technology is  fundamentally a research
problem;  perhaps  only  a  hundred  people  in  the  world  have  the
background necessary  to make advances in  the field. All  of them are
Ph.D.-level researchers with years of experience. The majority of them
are already  employed by the research  labs that have  been working on
the problem since its inception.

The  MP3 technology is  already open  in important  ways --  anyone is
welcome to buy the standard, read the source, and suggest improvements
or  make their  own implementations.  Even the  technology is  open --
patents are a  way of opening technology for  improvement, rather than
keeping it  as trade secrets.  The MP3 algorithm itself  was developed
through an  open peer-review process,  one of the major  advantages of
the open-source idea.

To use another  slogan of the open-source movement,  the technology is
free in a "free speech" sense, but is not free in a "free beer" sense.

To  use technologist  Eric Raymond's  terminology, the  development of
audio  compressors  is, at  heart,  a  "cathedral" process:  carefully
crafted  by individual  wizards or  small  bands of  mages working  in
splendid isolation, with no beta  to be released before its time. This
isn't because of  shortsightedness or over-protectiveness, it's simply
the way of the technology.

Which means that in order  to develop an open-source audio codec, some
individual  or small  group of  individuals must  have the  support to
spend years  researching the solution, the experience  to succeed, and
the  philosophical   bent  to  release  it   open-source  rather  than
potentially make lots of money by patenting it.

There are  MP3 players that  use the open-source  development process,
but this is different from  improving the codec itself, independent of
particular implementations.  There are  no obvious improvements  to be
made in the underlying technology, no matter how many eyes look at the
source code.

Some of  the call for  "open-source open standards" comes  from people
who think of building a  "competitor to MP3" as a software-development
process, rather than  as a research process.  This  is incorrect; only
the  development of  a  particular  encoder or  decoder  program is  a
software-development  task.  Making  a  new  standard  is  a  research
problem, and software-development solutions don't necessarily apply.

Are patents bad?

A  deeper argument that  I haven't  addressed is  a bit  radical: that
patents  encumbering   MP3  are  fundamentally   illegitimate  because
software patents are intrinsically wrong.

In general, there are too many patents issued today for ideas that are
too vague, too  broad, and too speculative. Patents  are being used as
weapons, contrary  to their original  purpose, which was  to encourage
invention by protecting the rights of inventors.

Patents   should  be  reserved   for  clearly   focused  technological
improvements that have  been reduced to practice, lead  to advances in
the art, and are truly not obvious.

Advances in audio coding technology held as patents today truly do fit
these categories. It  takes years of research --  with no guarantee of
success  -- to  make improvements  in the  technical aspects  of audio
compression.  A   person  of  "ordinary  skill"   can  appreciate  the
developments  once they  are discovered,  but cannot  readily discover
them  him/herself.  All of  the  innovations  are  quickly reduced  to
practice, since the companies developing  them want to use them in new
applications.

Companies doing  research in  audio compression make  huge investments
(millions  of $US)  based on  the  expectation that  they will  patent
results when they're finished. In  my opinion, they take the risk, and
are entitled to resultant benefits.
