<h1>AAC Settings Page</h1>

<!-- begin of text -->

<p>
This is the settings page for the AAC output module. AAC encoding and decoding is only available if the files "libfaac.dll" (for encoding) and "libfaad2.dll" (for decoding) are present in the winLAME folder. These files are only available as source code, which must be compiled before using. For more, look at: <a href="http://faac.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://faac.sourceforge.net/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
<b>Bitrate:</b> specifies the bitrate per channel the AAC encoder uses, in bps. Although there are some fixed settings you can cycle through with the up-down-buttons, any bitrate can be typed into the field.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bandwidth:</b> specifies the bandwidth the encoder uses of the audio input file, in Hz. Higher frequencies will be cut off.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mpeg Version:</b> lets you choose the MPEG version the output AAC file will be. Either 2 or 4.<br>
<b style="color:red;">Note:</b> libfaac currently doesn't support MPEG2 and the LTP object type at the same time.
</p>

<p>
<b>AAC Object Type:</b> lets you choose the object type that will be used for the output file.
</p>

<p>
<b>allow Mid/Side:</b> allows the AAC encoder to use Mid/Side encoding. Stereo signals are separated in a mid (left minus right) channel, and a side (left plus right) channel. Should only be used when there is low stereo separation.
</p>

<p>
<b>use TNS:</b> tells the AAC encoder to use Temporal Noise Shaping.
</p>

<p>
<b>use LFE channel:</b> tells the AAC encoder to use one channel as LFE channel. <i>libfaac doesn't currently support this.</i>
