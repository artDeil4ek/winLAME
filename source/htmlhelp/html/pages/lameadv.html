<h1>LAME Advanced Settings Page</h1>

<!-- begin of text -->

<p>
This is the settings page for advanced settings in LAME. If you don't know what to set here, just skip the page.

<h3>MP3 Header/Stream Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>mark as original:</b> marks the output file as being original
</p>

<p>
<b>mark as copyrighted:</b> marks the output file as being copyrighted
</p>

<p>
<b>error protection:</b> turns on CRC error protection. It will add a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code in each frame, allowing to detect transmission errors that could occur on the MP3 stream. However, it takes 16 bits per frame that would otherwise be used for encoding, and sound quality will be slightly reduced.
</p>

<p>
<b>strict ISO bitstream:</b> when set, LAME will enforce the 7680 bit limitation on total frame size. This results in many wasted bits for high bitrate encodings but will ensure strict ISO compatibility. This compatibility might be important for hardware players.
</p>

<p>
<b>disable bit reservoir:</b> disables LAME's internal bit reservoir when set. Each frame will then become independent from previous ones, but quality will be lower.
</p>

<h3>Filter Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>use lowpass filter:</b> enables lowpass filtering of input files. Cutoff Frequency is specified in Hz. As one normally cannot hear higher frequencies, no bits are used for those frequencies filtered.
</p>

<p>
<b>disable all filters:</b> tells the encoder to use full bandwidth and to disable all filters. By default, the encoder uses some highpass filtering at low bitrates, in order to keep a good quality by giving more bits to more important frequencies. Increasing the bandwidth from the default setting might produce ringing artefacts at low bitrates. Use with care!
</p>

<h3>ATH Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>disable ATH:</b> disables any use of the ATH (absolute threshold of hearing) for masking. Normally, humans are unable to hear any sound below this threshold. Disabling use of this feature might be usefull for music recorded at extremely low level.
</p>

<p>
<b>only use ATH:</b> this option causes LAME to ignore the output of the psy-model and only use masking from the ATH (absolute threshold of hearing). Might be useful at very high bitrates or for testing the ATH.
</p>

<p>
<b>lower the ATH:</b> lower the ATH (absolute threshold of hearing) by n dB. Normally, humans are unable to hear any sound below this threshold, but for music recorded at very low level this option might be useful.
</p>

<h3>Other Encoder Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>disable temporal masking effect:</b> disables the psychoacoustic model option when checked
</p>

<p>
<b>disable short blocks:</b> when checked, LAME encodes all frames using long blocks only. This could increase quality when encoding at very low bitrates, but can produce serious pre-echo artefacts.
