<h1>LAME Settings</h1>

<!-- begin of text -->

<p>
This is the settings page for the LAME encoder. All mp3 encoding settings are listed here.
</p>

<p>
<b>Encoding Quality</b><br/>
Can be one of "fast", "standard" and "high". Default is "standard". This option is the same
as the LAME command line options "-q 7" or "-f" (fast), and "-q 2" or "-h" (high). The
"standard" encoding quality is automatically chosen by LAME when omitting -f, -h or -q.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mono Encoding</b><br/>
When specified, LAME creates a mono mp3 file. If a stereo input file is used, both channels
are combined into one channel. This option is the same as the LAME command line option
"-a" (LAME then automatically chooses to do "-m m" then, too).
</p>

<p>
<b>Bitrate</b><br/>
Chooses bitrate mode instead of quality mode. In bitrate mode you can provide a bitrate that should
be used, either in ABR (average bitrate) or in CBR (constant bitrate) mode. If you want CBR
mode, check the <b>"Constant Bitrate"</b> mode. Note that ABR mode is recommended. In LAME the
CBR mode is the command line option "-b {bitrate}", ABR mode is "--abr {bitrate}".
</p>

<p>
<b>Quality</b><br/>
Chooses quality mode instead of bitrate mode. In quality mode you can provide a VBR quality level
that is used for encoding (quality mode actually means VBR mode). Quality levels range from 0
(high quality, large file) to 9 (bad quality, small file). In LAME the VBR quality value can be
set with "-V x" (where x is the quality value).
</p>

<p>
<b>Variable Bitrate Mode</b><br/>
In quality mode you can also set a VBR mode that is used for encoding. The available modes are
"standard" (recommended) and "fast". In LAME the "standard" mode is enabled with "-v" or
"--vbr-old" (default when not specified), and the "fast" mode is enabled with "--vbr-new".
