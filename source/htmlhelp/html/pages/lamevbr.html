<p>
This is the settings page for variable bitrate in LAME. This page only appears when "variable Bitrate" is selected on the <a href="lamebasic.html">LAME Basic Settings Page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Variable Bitrate Settings</h3>

<p>
<b>VBR Method:</b> lets you select the algorithm LAME will use for variable bitrate encoding.<br>
<b>new:</b> the new VBR algorithm; recommended to use<br>
<b>old:</b> old VBR algorithm<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>VBR Quality:</b> the quality to use for VBR. Lower values yield to better quality.
</p>

<p>
<b>enforce minimum Bitrate:</b> LAME enforces the minimum bitrate, which is normally violated for passages of music with absolute silence.
</p>

<p>
<b>write "VBR Info" tag:</b> when using VBR, LAME can write a special info tag at the start of the mp3 file. The tag contains various infos about the encoder settings, as well as a frame bitrate histogram. VBR Info tag aware players can correctly seek and compute playing times when this tag is written. Note that the Info tag is omitted when using nogap encoding. The VBR Info tag was previously called Xing tag.
